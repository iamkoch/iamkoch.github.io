Hit a bit of an issue at work today. Our models were decorated with the standard DataAnnotations attributes such as Required and RegEx-based ones, but couldn't get them to fire.
After some trawling I came across a page with the answer.
{% highlight javascript %}
$.validator.unobtrusive.parse('#formName');
{% endhighlight %}
Calling this once the form is on the page, i.e. if invoked via the Ajax helper passing in the method to the OnSuccess AJaxOption, e.g.
{% highlight javascript %}
new AjaxOptions { OnSuccess = "validateMyForm" }
{% endhighlight %}
with the following as the Javascript function being called
{% highlight javascript %}
function validateMyForm() {
    return $.validator.unobtrusive.parse('#formName');
}
{% endhighlight %}
allowed the unobtrusive ajax to work.
