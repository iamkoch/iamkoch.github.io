Is it me, or is everyone trying to adopt agile instead of merrily working through the process?
Portions of a business can appear to be using agile practices, however how often does it really run right through the business's core values? Do the directors get it? Does everyone in the company adhere to the agile manifesto, truthfully?


Individuals and interactions over processes and tools


Working software over comprehensive documentation


Customer collaboration over contract negotiation


Responding to change over following a plan


I imagine when we go to dev meetups or QA conferences we all tell each other just how agile we are, but in reality are we all secretly telling porkies?
Does anyone have any positive tales about turning around a business, or any tips for getting the waterfall merchants on board?
I think there should be a kind of agile check list, much like the (slightly outdated) Joel test for development teams - I'm going to do some hunting around and see what's out there and report back here later.
