It ain't great but it's the best you can do.
I stumbled across this page http://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/ which I will let you read, but basically it gives you some nice conditional HTML to make older IE versions behave like IE9.
This is great because to be honest IE9 isn't so bad, it's the other browsers that make it a pain. This library sorts that out to make you slightly happier in your work.
Slightly.
