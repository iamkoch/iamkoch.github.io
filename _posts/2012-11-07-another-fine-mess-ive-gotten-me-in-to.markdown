I'm both excited and petrified about talking at Agile Dev PracticesÂ running March 4-7th in Berlin next year.

I'll be talking with the testing tweetmeister Tony Bruce, discussing BDD lessons learnt from our previous roles.

It'll be an interesting talk as I've experienced the highs and lows of BDD in two previous roles now, as well as going through the motions in my current role at Amido, so I feel I've a lot to talk about and a lot to discuss abou how to cut the wheat from the chaff and get down to transitioning to a BDD-style approach, or improving your current one.
