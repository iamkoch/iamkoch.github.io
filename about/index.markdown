<p>My name is Antony Koch, as the website suggests, and I'm a passionate software developer from Brighton, England.</p>
<p>I love development as both a hobby and a profession, and enjoy nothing more than learning new languages and frameworks, and poking around with other peoples' code.</p>
<p>I'm currently contracting and start a new contract working on some really exciting stuff on 10th September. I'll hopefully be posting more about open source software as a result which is something I'm really excited about. </p>
<p>When I'm not sitting behind some kind of computer (preferably made by Apple!) I am currently learning to windsurf, as well as spending time with my beautiful and rather pregnant fiance <a title="Vicky" href="http://vickybigmore.com" target="_blank">Vicky</a>.</p>
